# Gmail automated accounting with Apps Script

_WORK IN PROGRESS_

## Description

This project is a simple example of how to automate accounting with Gmail,
BigQuery and Apps Script. It automatically searches e-mails containing
invoices and purchase receipts, based on search criteria set by the user
per each merchant that needs to be tracked. The data is then extracted,
categorized and saved to a spreadsheet in Google Sheets or a BigQuery table.
